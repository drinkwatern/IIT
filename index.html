    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
      <p> Hey, I’m Nick! I was born in Sydney but grew up in Melbourne. Both of my parents were born in Australia and I’ve got two siblings, an older sister and a younger brother. I’ve actually previously started this degree, back in 2015 but after doing half a year, I stopped to go travel and live overseas for 2 years in Edinburgh, Scotland! Now that we can’t travel overseas due to Coronavirus, I thought what better time to come back and finish my degree.</p>
      <p>I love travelling and have been all around Europe, Singapore, to the US four times and to New Zealand! I love films and my favourite sport is baseball (Go Cubs!).

    <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
    <h5> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h5>
    <p>My interest in IT started from playing video games and being the overall go to person for any tech issues that my family had! With video games being my hobby, I transitioned into building my own computers as a teenager which really stoked my interest in IT, by being able to see how a computer works and make one from scratch myself! My interests in IT now include programming, building IT systems and hardware!</p>
    <h5>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h5>
    <p>Building my first computer is definitely the event that sparked my interest in IT! Before I attempted it, building a computer from scratch seemed like a impossible task but by breaking down the components and finding out what each part did, it made me appreciate the beauty and simplicity of IT and what it can achieve! Whilst I don’t have any formal IT experience, as I mentioned previously, I have always been the go to for any IT related issues for my family or partner and have found that I have quite the knack for fixing IT related issues in many situations, including also for my colleagues at work!</p>
    <h5>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h5>
    <p>I choose RMIT due to the option of being able to study full time online instead of having to attend in person. As my about me mentioned, I have also previously done in person learning at RMIT and found that it wasn’t the most efficient way of learning. As I now have a full time job and am looking to continue to save up money for my next overseas adventure, coming back to RMIT to study full time online was the logical choice!  </p>
    <h5>What do you expect to learn during your studies?  </h5>
    <p>I foremost expect to learn the necessary skills and knowledge to help me enter the IT field as a career. More than that though, I hope that my studies will inspire and engage me in topics and fields of IT that I haven’t seen or encountered before. I also hope to continue to develop my passion and interest in IT and be amazed at what it can do, just like I was amazed when my first PC I built actually turned on! </p>

    <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
    <h5>Job Description</h5>
    <p>Whilst this fits a bit more into the dream job category, rather than ideal job, I have chosen this job as this is what excites me so much about IT: being able to use it to achieve things that were previously unachievable, such as travelling to Mars. The descirption of this job includes developing and deploying software using Python and a program called LabVIEW to support and enable mission software used to control and monitor rockets on the launchpad. The job requires hand on integration of software, as well as testing and analysis of those testings to continue to ensure there are no bugs for such an important task.</p>
    <h5>Job Skills Required</h5>
    <p>Whilst the jobs does ask for a degree in computer science, engineering, math or science, it also allows you to apply with at least 2+ years of experience in software development. Therefore the skills required would include first graduating and then receving those 2+ years of experince. It's also a requirment to be proficent in the use of Python and a program called LabVIEW which is a a graphical programming language that SpaceX employs. </p>
    <h5>Job Skills Possessed</h5>
    <p>As I’m still quite new to the field of IT, there aren’t too many skills I possess yet that this job requires such as a proficent knowedlge in Java or LabVIEW. However I believe that I definitely fulfil the ask that I “enjoy end-user facing roles for support and interfacing with cross-functional teams” as well as having “experience with other software or scripting languages” as I have experience with Java and Python.</p>
    <h5>Plan</h5>
    <p>My plan for a job like this would be to first graduate university and then obtain the neccesary experience in software development that primarily uses Python and other programming langueages, such as Java. This would invole me finding a job where I am able to obtain this 2+ years of software development experince required. For this job in particular, it is required that you are a US citizen, which whilst I would love to live in the US, citizzenship can be a pretty tough to obtain. Therefore I would need to exlpore the options avalibale to me to make me eligable to obtain the required visa.</p>

      </p>
    </li>
    <h4>Results Discussion</h4>
    <h5> What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h5>
    <p>These test results confirm what I've discovered about myself in the last couple of years and what I want to continue to work on, as I believe being good natured, supportive and respectful of people is one of the best things that people can be to each other and some of the best traits to have in a workplace! With these results, it also shows that I tend to shy away from social situations and am introverted, which I am hoping that uni will be able to help with! </p>
    <h5>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h5>
    <p>I believe that these test results put me in a really good position for working within a team! My strengths of being thoughtful, generous and being open minded will mesh really well within a team as I'm always respectful and open to any ideas that my group mates may have! As I do tend to shy away from social situations and am more introverted, these could negatively affect working in a group, therefore I know that I will need to work on and overcome these to ensure that I am involed and active within a team.</p>
    <h5>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h5>
    <p>I would really like to strive towards having similarly respectful and thoughtful people in my team as my results show that I tend to avoid conflict and drama and I hope that as I can tend to be self critical and impractical at times, I have determined and encouraging team members who can nudge me back onto the path if these negative traits start to overtake and influence my strengths.</p>
